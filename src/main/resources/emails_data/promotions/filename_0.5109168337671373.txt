** Building the World's Greatest Library

Hernando Colón sailed with his father Christopher Columbus on his final voyage to the New World—a journey that ended in disaster, bloody mutiny, and shipwreck. After Columbus’s death in 1506, eighteen-year-old Hernando sought to surpass his father’s campaign to explore the boundaries of the known world, by building a library that would collect everything ever printed. Last month, author Edward Wilson-Lee joined us to discuss historic archives, modern information landscapes, and what it takes to build a library of universal knowledge.

A 40-Year-Old Future

Imagine if How It’s Made was narrated by William Shatner. In Robotics: The Future Is Now! (https://archive.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38bd6154386f64fcd92204a25&id=73f0d37e22&e=a830d4b874) , the Star Trek actor introduces viewers to the cutting-edge (in 1984) science of robotics. Although these “Steel Collar Workers” represent both a marvel of technological advancement and an uncertain future for humans in the workforce, Shatner ends the video on a hopeful note: “Perhaps robotics can lead to a better life for all of us.” Watch the video here (https://archive.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38bd6154386f64fcd92204a25&id=a26609ca57&e=a830d4b874) , or check out this writeup from Vice magazine (https://archive.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38bd6154386f64fcd92204a25&id=19fceaea0d&e=a830d4b874) !

Like most Broadway musicals, The Sound of Music embellishes on certain aspects of history with song and dance. But one element of the story is true: the Trapp family did sing in real life and became well known for their vocal talents in Europe and the United States, after fleeing Austria during World War II. Hear the actual recorded voices of Georg and Maria von Trapp and their many children in this vinyl LP: An Evening of Folk Songs With The Trapp Family Singers.

–Sari M.

* "I am an anthropologist working in a region of the world where it is challenging to find documentation (the Congo River Basin).

Imagine if How It’s Made was narrated by William Shatner. In Robotics: The Future Is Now!, the Star Trek actor introduces viewers to the cutting-edge (in 1984) science of robotics. Although these “Steel Collar Workers” represent both a marvel of technological advancement and an uncertain future for humans in the workforce, Shatner ends the video on a hopeful note: “Perhaps robotics can lead to a better life for all of us.” Watch the video here, or check out this writeup from Vice magazine!

Like most Broadway musicals, The Sound of Music embellishes on certain aspects of history with song and dance. But one element of the story is true: the Trapp family did sing in real life and became well known for their vocal talents in Europe and the United States, after fleeing Austria during World War II. Hear the actual recorded voices of Georg and Maria von Trapp and their many children in this vinyl LP: An Evening of Folk Songs With The Trapp Family Singers.

Whenever somebody contributes to the Internet Archive, we ask them: Why did you donate? The answers are insightful, intriguing, and inspiring—here are a few of our recent favorites!


	"I LOVE the Internet Archive. I love reading memoirs and books written from the early 1800s through mid 1950s, that are often not available on Kindle. Chances are I'll find it on Internet Archive." 
	–Sari M.
	 
	"I am an anthropologist working in a region of the world where it is challenging to find documentation (the Congo River Basin). More than a few times, the Internet Archive and Wayback Machine have helped me to find resources that are significant for my scholarship. I am donating to express my gratitude and support for this important project!”
	–Stephanie R.
	 
	"The IA is an important tool for everyone and we would be significantly worse off without it."
	–Robert B.

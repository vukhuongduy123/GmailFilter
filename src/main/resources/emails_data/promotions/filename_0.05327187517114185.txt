** Why We #OwnBooks

The Internet Archives is home to more than 38 million books and texts, accessed by thousands of users each day. More than 2 million of these works are available through Controlled Digital Lending, which is made possible because the Internet Archive owns a copy of every book we lend. This month, we’ve been celebrating book ownership on Twitter with the #OwnBooks hashtag–simply choose a book that you’ve owned for a long time and tell us why it’s important to you! Peruse the responses here (https://archive.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38bd6154386f64fcd92204a25&id=206c59c997&e=a830d4b874) , learn more about why book ownership matters (https://archive.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=38bd6154386f64fcd92204a25&id=7dbdf5259f&e=a830d4b874), or add your own contribution today!

You Spin Me Right Round

Do you ever just want to stare at a gif of a spinning doughnut? Who doesn’t?

Juliane Koepcke


17 year old Juliane Koepcke was sucked out of an airplane in 1971 after it was struck by a bolt of lightning. She fell 2 miles to the ground, still strapped in her seat and survived after spending 10 days in the Amazon jungle.

After ten days, she found a boat moored near a shelter, and found the boat's fuel tank still partly full. Koepcke poured the gasoline on her wounds, which she in turn thought it helped with killing the maggots in her wounds.

1971, Chamberlain wanted to challenge Ali in a boxing match for his heavyweight title.


Chamberlain was 35 years old, a year away from retiring from the NBA after 13 seasons during which he had set more than 70 individual records. He was a huge man, 7 feet tall, 275 pounds, and astonishingly strong, agile and fast. Ali was 29 in 1971.

There are several versions of why the fight never happened. One says Wilt's lawyers advised him against the battle since he would earn very little money after taxes, so the risk wasn't worth it.

Question: In what real-world applications is the decision tree classifier used?


Answer from Mike West


I’m glad someone on this thread works in the real-world.

We don’t use decision trees alone in the real-world.

Why? They aren’t the best model for classification and regr

Question: What makes naive Bayes biased?


Answer from Shayne Miel


Both classifiers are linear models. With logistic regression, you are tuning the weights of the model so that they minimize an error function. Naive Bayes, on the other ha

Question: Why is "naive Bayes" naive?


Answer from Akash Agarwal


Naive bayes algorithm has two parts: 1st is Bayes and 2nd is naive. Bayes is for simple reason that it uses the Bayes theorem to calculate the conditional probabiilty. Let

Question: What is an intuitive explanation of a naive Bayes classifier?


Answer from Henry Zhu


Naive Bayes Classifier is based upon two important principles: the assumption that all features are independent (the “Naive” part of the classifier) and Bayes’ theorem.

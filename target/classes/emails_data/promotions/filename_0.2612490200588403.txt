Question: How can we determine the number of comparisons in "Binary Search"?

Answer from Akshay P. Shinde

The time complexity or O(n) of Binary search is log n (base 2) as the "domain" halves after each comparison, so if you half a million 21 times you will reach 1 answer which wi

Question: How can we determine the number of comparisons in a "linear search"?

Answer from Lokesh Chandekar

Linear Search searches for the required element in linear manner (as per the name) or goes through elements one by one , searching for the required one.

In this process, the

Question: How do you find the number of comparisons in a binary search?

Answer from Gerry Rzeppa

The number of comparisons varies depending on how big a thing you’re searching, and how lucky you are. This is a typical binary search:

Question: How can 100 determine the number of comparisons in "Binary Search"?

Answer from Irné Barnard

Not sure I understand the question. What throws me is just what you mean by “100”.

Question: What is the maximum number of comparisons that a binary search function will make when searching for a value in a 1,000 - element array?

Answer from Mohamed Abou-Emish

Suppose you are searching for a number which is located at index 498 in an array of 1000 element, let’s do Binary Search “halving” using Math.Floor till we find the element.

Question: How many comparisons are needed for a binary search in a set of 64 elements?

Answer from Nishad

Suppose there are N elements in the set, the general understanding of encountering a search element is :

(N/2^K) = 1

(LHS = number of divides needed in terms of 2 to narrow

Question: If the array (sorted array) is having 100 elements, what is the maximum number of comparisons in binary search tree?

Answer from Someone anonymous

I believe log(n) to the base 2. where n is the number of elements. F(n) is said to be O(G(n)) for all n>=some n if F(n)<=kG(n) where F(n) and G(n) are functions , and k is con

Question: How can I count the number of comparisons done in a Java binary search between the key and elements in array?

Answer from Chris Hayworth

On average, it should be less than log base 2 of (n) where n is the # of elements in the array. So O(log(n))

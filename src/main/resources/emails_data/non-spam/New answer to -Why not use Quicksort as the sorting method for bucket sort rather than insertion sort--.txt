Scott answered the question "Why not use Quicksort as the sorting method for bucket sort rather than insertion sort?":

"You could use any sort you like there. The idea, though, is that the number of items in a bucket is likely to be quite small. So you should pick a sort efficiently sorts small lists.

If your lists aren’t quite small, that implies that your values aren’t fairly evenly distributed, which means bucket sort may not be the right tool for the job. But if you wanted to stick with bucket sort even though you had very uneven lists then yes, you should choose something else as your sort within a bucket."

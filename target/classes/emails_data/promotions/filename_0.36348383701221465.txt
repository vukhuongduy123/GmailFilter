But there's a catch, XYZ companies have 50 LPA CTC at NIT/IIT, but the in-hand pay is way less than you thought. Base salary is nothing more than ₹ 12 or 13 lakhs + Yearly Bonus = ₹ 1,20,000 Stocks - ₹ 22,00,000 over 4 years. Something we cannot include as part of CTC. Whatever their salary is, You can UPSKILL at ZERO.

Question: Can someone give an intuitive proof on the running time of building heap procedure in O(n)?

Answer from Supriya Priyadarshani

Algorithm of Build Heap:

BUILD-HEAP(A)
 heapsize := size(A); 
 for i := floor(heapsize/2) down to 1 
 do HEAPIFY(A, i); 
 end for 
END

Question: Why must a heap of size n have height floor(log(n))?

Answer from Rohit Nandi

A heap is a Tree which satisfies the following two properties:

1. All the child nodes must be less (or greater) than its parent node for a min (or max) heap.

2. The leaves m

Question: What’s the simple explanation for O(n log n)?

Answer from Kristijan Burnik

Having an asymptotic time complexity of [math]O(n*log(n))[/math] means you’re doing way better than [math]O(n^2)[/math] (quadratic) but worse than [math]O(n)[/math] (linear).

Question: What is an intuitive explanation of a min heap?

Answer from Krishna Kannan

Min heap is a tree based heap data structure which satisfies the heap property. 

Let’s consider the Binary min heap which is based on the Binary tree.

Having said that, in t

Question: What's an intuitive way to understand O(n) for different n?

Answer from Joshua Engel

If you have twice as much data, it will take no more than twice as long*.

If you have ten times as much data, it will take no more than ten times as long.

And so on.

Question: Is O(log n) always faster than O(n)?

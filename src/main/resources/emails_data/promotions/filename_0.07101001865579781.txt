Question: What is hyper-threading? How does it different from multithreading?


Answer from Mark Hahn


There is no difference.  Hyperthreading is precisely cycle-resolution time-slicing.  That implies the most important property of HT: that it benefits most codes which are

Question: What are some best examples of multithreaded applications?


Answer from Hariny G


The main purpose of multithreading is to provide simultaneous execution of two or more parts of a program that can run concurrently.

Threads are independent. If an except

Question: Why does Python not support multithreading?


Answer from Joe Zbiciak


If it isn't possible, then why do some Python implementations have a GIL? [ https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock ]

The answer, of course, is that Python doe

Question: What are two programming examples in which multithreading does not provide better performance than a single-threaded solution?


Answer from Stephen Kayara


If the threads are fighting over the same CPU, nothing is accomplished.

If the threads are ‘short’, the overhead for instantiating them will hurt performance.

Question: What is counting sort?

Answer from Md. Rakibul Islam

Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then doin

Question: What is an intuitive explanation of A* search?

Answer from Robert Zubek

Other posters answered this by comparison with Dijkstra, so I'm going to try a different perspective: comparing to breadth-first and depth-first search.

Depth-first search is

Question: What is an intuitive explanation of QuickSort?

Answer from Arjun Mani

Quicksort, in essence, is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts by partitioning and recursion.


The above sentence might as well be Greek to you, and I understand that. T

Question: What is an intuitive explanation of merge sort?

Answer from Rcgldr

The simplest explanation is probably best described using bottom up merge sort. Consider an array of n elements as n runs with 1 element each. Since each run only has 1 elemen

Question: What is an intuitive explanation of selection sort?

Answer from Finn Frankis

In summary, selection sort entails iteration over an array of any size, where each iteration finds the minimum unsorted value and appends it to the sorted portion of the array

Question: What is an intuitive explanation of the Master Theorem?

Answer from Suresh Venkat

Brian' s answer is very comprehensive. But let me give you a less formal and maybe more "exciting" version of the answer. 

There are two terms in the master theorem: the [mat

Question: What is an intuitive explanation of the counting process?

Answer from Kevin Bar

We count by defining, naming and accumulating, adding or subtracting particles of matter. The process has been conditioned into our consciousness from a very young age.

Question: What is an intuitive explanation of a Hilbert space?

Answer from Daniel McLaury

To understand what a Hilbert space is, you must first understand what an inner product space is, since a Hilbert space is an inner product space with a particular nice propert

Question: What is a counting sort algorithm?

Answer from David Rutter

Here is counting sort for integers in Python:

def sort(l):
  h=dd(int)
  out=[]
  for x in l:
    h[x] += 1

Question: What is an intuitive explanation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm?

Answer from Henry Chen

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm generates a sequence of random samples from a probabilistic distribution for which direct sampling is often difficult.

It builds upon the Ma

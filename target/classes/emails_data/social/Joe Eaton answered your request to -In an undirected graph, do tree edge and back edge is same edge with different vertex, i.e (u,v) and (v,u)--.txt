Joe Eaton answered the question "In an undirected graph, do tree edge and back edge is same edge with different vertex, i.e (u,v) and (v,u)?":

"Yes, this is the most common model for an undirected graph. Instead of having only 1 of the directions, the graph has both (u,v) and (v,u) for each edge. In a matrix representation, this is the same as the matrix being symmetric A(i,j)= A(j,i)"

Yes, this is the most common model for an undirected graph. Instead of having only 1 of the directions, the graph has both (u,v) and (v,u) for each edge. In a matrix representation, this is the same as the matrix being symmetric A(i,j)= A(j,i)

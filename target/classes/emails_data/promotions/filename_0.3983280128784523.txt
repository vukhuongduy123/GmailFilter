Question: Does an octa-core processor mean that I can run 8 processes parallel at the same time without any time lag?


Answer from Simon Gardner


Yes kind of, but it very much depends on what those processes are doing and how they are doing it.

Most programs require frequent access to memory (ie RAM) and with a mul

Question: Can multi core cpu run multiple processes in parallel?


Answer from Erik Fair


Consider the phrase “central processing unit” - it implies exactly one processor.

A “multicore CPU” is a contradiction in terms - if there’s more than processor, how can

It’s officially the ‘Can’t keep calm’ season (placement season)!  How are you feeling about it?  
You must be thinking about all the money you would be getting after getting placed and must have planned out everything that you are going to do, right? Well, if you think of getting placed through campus, then chances are that you might not land your dream job with a dream salary.  But, let’s come back to earth for a while. You might get placed through campus, but there is no guarantee that you’ll get a good salary and do all the stuff you thought about.  
So, take a step forward and join Career Camp Freshers. A 9-month coding Boot Camp that can help you to land your first tech job in companies like Google and Amazon.

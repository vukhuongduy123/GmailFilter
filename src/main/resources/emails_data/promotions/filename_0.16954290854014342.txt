What the experts are saying 
 
  
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 "Organizations do themselves a disservice when they limit innovation to only a small designated team. They miss out on opportunities to increase efficiency, improve processes, and better the customer experience across all departments."

 Dynamic Matrix  This one feature can help you turn your ideas into actionable insights much faster. Create a Dynamic Matrix in 3 steps! 
 
Select shapes, sticky notes, and cards on your canvas. 
In the Context Panel, select the Container options icon. 
From the options, select Dynamic Matrix. 
  From there, set filters for your rows or columns to view your ideas in new ways. You’ll quickly spot patterns and identify common themes.  Learn more

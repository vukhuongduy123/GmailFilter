Question: How do you iterate through a c++ priority queue that has custom objects within it?

Answer from Vishal Oza

In real general C++ code, you cannot iterate because a priority queue does not have iterator. However the std::priority_queue does have a container that implements the queue.

Question: How is priority queue implemented in C++? How is it done using STL?

Answer from Rob Menke

It is implemented as a façade class over a [code ]std::vector[/code] using either the native sorting of the element type or a supplied comparator. Any container supporting ran

Question: Does C++ support Lambda expressions?

Answer from Drazen Zoric

Yes, starting with C++11 (so started in 2011 and bit earlier).
But C++11 implementation was very limited to single line functions without local variables. C++14 brought needed

Question: How do I solve this priority queue exercise?

Answer from Shuai Zhang

Obviously the `IPriorityQueue` is the core. Its inner elements are of type `IKeyValue`. During enqueues and dequeues, the `returnSorted` method would be periodically called to

Question: How do you pass parameters to a lambda function in C++?

Answer from Abrar Hassan

Lambda functions in C++ are expressed as

[code ][ captures ] (parameters) -> returnTypesDeclaration { lambdaStatements; }[/code]

So as an example you can define a lambda fun

Question: How do you return a value from a lambda function in C++?

Answer from Er-Godic

Here is a minimal example.

{

return “potato”;

}();

You just return inside the lambda.

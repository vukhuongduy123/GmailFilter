Question: Are symbol tables and linkers connected in C++?

Answer from James Durdan

When the compiler compiles a .cpp code module, it encounters symbols that are exported from that module such as class names, global variables, constants. It knows where, withi

Question: Is it a bad practice to pass arguments by reference in C++ since it obscures at call site which arguments will be modified while passing pointer makes it explicit?

Answer from Nathan F Yospe

No. Passing arguments as pointers in the manner recommended by Google’s C++ style guide is a very bad practice, and its proponents need to be publicly shamed.

Question: How do I choose between static and dynamic linking for C++ project?

Answer from Rob Menke

It depends on what your needs are for the project and what you have available.

Question: What is the difference between static and dynamic linking?

Answer from Satyendra Singh

Before moving on to the difference, lets see the linking process in brief.

Why linker ?

When you write some C code (or any other language), it is stored in .c format.

Question: What is the difference between a static variable and global variable in C/C++?

Answer from Greg Kemnitz

The difference between this is in scope.  A truly global variable has global scope, and is visible everywhere in your program, ie

[code]#include <stdio.h>

int my_global_var

Question: How do you define a static struct in C++?

Answer from Dustin Dettmer

Stucts cannot be declared static in C or C++. Until some upgrade comes along to either language giving that some meaning, it means absolutely nothing.

Question: What are the pros and cons of static and dynamic linking in c++?

Answer from Jennica Pounds

Static linking will speed up the program by eliminating an extra jump of indirection in code execution. I've observed as much as 2x performance improvement by forcing static l

Question: Why doesn’t the C++ committee standardize linking, like for C?

Question: How do you check if a key exists in a map in C++?

Answer from Avijit Bandyopadhyay

You call find and check the return value (an iterator of the map) to see if it’s the end iterator.

eg

[code]std::map< int, int > myMap; // the map

// some insertions happen

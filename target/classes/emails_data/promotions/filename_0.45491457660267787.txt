Last night, the Internet Archive officially announced a brand new initiative: Democracy’s Library (https://archive.org/details/democracys-library) . We believe that free and open access to public information is critical for any functioning democracy, and that every citizen should be able to seek knowledge in the public domain. That’s why we’re working to collect important government documents, so that citizens everywhere can be better informed.

Our goal is to digitize, catalog, and make findable government materials, starting with the U.S. and Canada. This includes laws, scientific studies and reports, safety standards, patents, copyright records, and so much more. The Democracy's Library project will allow scholars, journalists, educators, businesses, the general public, or anyone with a thirst for knowledge to easily find the information these governments have produced, much of it at taxpayer expense.

The Democracy’s Library collection already contains more than 500,000 government documents, ranging from legislative proceedings to historic farmers’ bulletins. A few highlights include:
* An assortment of automobile crash-test reports from the ​​National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22Automobiles+--+Crashworthiness+--+Testing%22)
* A series of Q&As by researchers at state agricultural experiment stations, answering questions from homemakers about everyday household problems (https://archive.org/details/questionboxansw942unit_39/page/n1/mode/2up)
* “Gobbledygook Has Gotta Go”—a 1966 government document about excessive jargon in government documents (https://archive.org/details/gobbledygookhasg3836ohay/mode/1up)
* A collection of historical textbooks (https://archive.org/details/nle-historicaltextbooks) from the National Library of Education
* A NASA report about the possibility of alien life (https://archive.org/details/nasa-reports_nas-121512/page/n1/mode/1up) existing within the Solar System

Take a look and see what you can find!

In the future, our goal is to bring all U.S. Federal, U.S. State, and Canadian government documents (including laws, books and reports) online through digitization and web archiving. We hope to digitize millions of paper documents, process vast quantities of microfilm, partner with institutions that hold similar collections, and develop search systems that will allow citizens to better interact with these materials.

I have ADD not ADHD. Is that still a thing? Iâ€™m not hyper matter of fact Iâ€™m always exhausted. Well, not anymore until my meds wear off. I have always just had memory, focus and motivation problems.

I started meds last month since I had my baby I could start again. My motivation is just WOW and I act on it.

My energy levels are better. I mean I can still fall asleep during the day itâ€™s just it helps my mind be more aware and awake. Meanwhile my bodyâ€™s like nah screw this lol

I just need someone who understands me man.

I done forgot the point in this post (itâ€™s 10pm) I just got my kids to sleep but if anyone wants to be my friend in crime then pm me lol!

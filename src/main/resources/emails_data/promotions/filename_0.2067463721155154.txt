Road trips. Hanging with friends. Nothing beats summer.And with just a bit of prep, you can take that same great feeling with you when you head back to campus this fall. Get Started1. Create a daily routineWith so much freedom in college, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Having a good daily routine can keep you on track while you explore new things.2. Tap into your college’s resourcesYour college has a ton of support services, most of them free. Spend an hour on their website to dig around for what would help you most.3. Own your experienceCollege is all about you and what you want for your life, not what others want for you. Embrace your agency and focus on creating strong connections with people who are on your path.4. Care for your body and your mindCollege requires a lot of hard work. You’ll meet the challenge more easily when you feed yourself well, exercise often, and do regular check-ins on your mental health.5. Don’t go it aloneGet help early and often from a variety of sources: your professors, your fellow students, YouTube experts (properly vetted, please), and Course Hero’s study guides and tutoring help.Get StartedCourse Hero – coursehero.com2000 Seaport Blvd., 3rd FloorRedwood City, CA 94063Help Center — Terms of Use — Privacy — Unsubscribe

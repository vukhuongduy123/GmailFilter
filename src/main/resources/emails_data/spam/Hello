Dear Sir/Madam,

Sorry for this interruption. I am looking for a local business minded person from your region to work with. I would like to read your response to see if you would be interested in the business.

I need one particular product from your region and I would like to know if you would like to be the one to source this product from your region and supply it to my company. It is a genuine product that you have every right to ignore if you are not satisfied with the terms and conditions.

Reply back for more details. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best wishes,

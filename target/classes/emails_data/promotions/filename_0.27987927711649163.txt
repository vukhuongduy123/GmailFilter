Take a gander at V-Discs from our 78s collection and hear the patriotic performances of yesteryear!

For military members deployed during World War II, familiar entertainment from beloved musicians was hard to find.

Enter V-Disc, a record label created by the American military during World War II to boost soldier morale while abroad. From 1943 to 1949, many popular artists recorded with friends and acquaintances at rival record labels. By the end of the decade, however, the masters had been destroyed and any existing V-Discs at military bases discarded.

Luckily, the Internet Archive’s Great 78 Project (http://great78.archive.org/) features a large number of these V-Disc recordings, which range from military marching songs to love ballads, and big band to swing. Below are just a handful of the V-Discs available to browse–but you can see the full collection here: https://archive.org/details/georgeblood?query=Publisher%3AVdisc*

"Way Down Yonder in New Orleans" — Connee Boswell and her V-Disc Music Men

Connee Boswell was an American singer born in Kansas City but raised in New Orleans. She sang with her sisters as part of The Boswell Sisters in the 1920s and 30s, but continued as a solo artist after the group disbanded in 1936. She sang while seated—either in a wheelchair or chair—due to a childhood illness. She was an inspiration to Ella Fitzgerald and a frequent duet partner of Bing Crosby.

"Melodrama in a V-Disc Record Room"/"Airmail Special" — Benny Carter and his Orchestra; Jimmy Mundy and his Orchestra

With a music career lasting into the 1990s, few musicians had the same longevity in jazz as Benny Carter. He played sax, clarinet and trumpet, along with composing and leading his band. Carter won his eighth Grammy in 1994—when he was 87 years old.

Jimmy Mundy, on the other hand, is more known for his arrangements for other jazz musicians than his own music. He had few releases under his own name, instead doing work for jazz legends Chet Baker, Earl Hines, and Benny Goodman.

"The Army Air Corps Song" — Major Glenn Miller and the Band of the AAF Training Command

Glenn Miller tried his hardest to join the war effort, but the Navy told him no. He was 38 years old and at the peak of his career, but his sense of civic duty sent him to the U.S. Army, where he persuaded Army Brigadier General Charles Young to let him modernize the Army band. Miller rose to the rank of Major during his time in the Army, and disappeared on a flight from Bedford, England, to Paris on December 15, 1944.

"Wave to Me My Lady" — Dinning Sisters; Former Sgt. William Stein

“Wave to Me My Lady” is the only V-Disc on this list that begins with a spoken introduction. This happened occasionally—musicians and band leaders taking a moment to bolster the troops and tell them they were rooting for them. This song, written by William Stein and Frank Loesser before they left the Army, is performed by the Dinning Sisters’ original lineup of Lou, Jean and Ginger Dinning.

"What a Diff’rence A Day Made" — Sammy Kaye and his Orchestra, Nancy Norman

"Swing and Sway with Sammy Kaye" was one of the most famous taglines in the Big Band era. Kaye, a songwriter and bandleader, was also widely known for singing the titles of songs, even if he wasn’t providing the vocals for the track itself. (You can hear it in this song!) Vocalist Nancy Norman sang frequently with Kaye, and she had at least two hits in the Billboard Top 10 in the 1940s. “What A Diff’rence A Day Made” was originally written in Spanish and covered in English, both released in 1934. The song later gained significant popularity in 1959 when it was covered by Dinah Washington.

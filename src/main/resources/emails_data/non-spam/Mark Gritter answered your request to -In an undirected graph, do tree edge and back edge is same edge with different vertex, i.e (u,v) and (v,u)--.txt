Mark Gritter answered the question "In an undirected graph, do tree edge and back edge is same edge with different vertex, i.e (u,v) and (v,u)?":

"In the context of depth-first search, a “tree edge” is an edge selected by the DFS algorithm, while a “back edge” is one that is not selected, but exists between a node and its ancestor.

These, by definition, cannot be the same edge. One is selected and the other is not.

Just like in a directed graph, the presence of a back edge indicates a cycle. For example, suppose our DFS tree looks like this:

The if the graph has an edge F—D (indicated by the dotted line) it is a back edge (or forward edge.) All the solid edges are tree edges.

In an undirected graph, there is no distinction between a “back edge” and a “forward edge”; they are the same thing. However, less trivially, in an undirected graph DFS cannot produce any “cross edges” between unrelated nodes.

For example, could C—E be a cross edge, if it was present in the graph? No, because we would either have visited E immediately from C if it existed, or C would be one of the children of E. In the latter case, A—C would be a back edge, not a cross edge."

Question: What are the advantages of brute force algorithm over other techniques?


Answer from Vidhya Kamakshi


An advantage of brute force algorithm is that at the end of it you can definitely find the optimal solution. There are a few approximation algorithms that runs in polynomi

Question: What are the disadvantages of brute force algorithm?


Answer from Sonya Morris


The most obvious advantage is that your chance of actually finding the password is quite high since the attack uses so many possible answers. Another advantage is that it

Question: What are examples of problems with simple brute force algorithms (with terrible complexities), but which also have better algorithms (with incredibly good complexities)?


Answer from Dan Stahlke


The fast Fourier transform (FFT), discovered by Gauss around 1805 and rediscovered most significantly by Cooley and Tukey around 1965, runs in time O(n log n) whereas the

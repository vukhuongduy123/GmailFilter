Question: Can an SSD be coupled with regular HDD for a RAID 1 configuration in NAS?


Answer from Vladislav Zorov


I think it should be possible - SSDs expose the same "interface" as hard drives do, so the RAID controller shouldn't have a problem with that.

However, I'm not sure it's

Question: If we mix SSD and HDD on JBOD (not RAID 0) configuration, will we get a performance penalty?


Answer from Robert Lee


No, not if you really do keep them as independent disks and exported them as such. If you set things up just right, you may in fact see a significant performance improveme

Question: If SSDs are "much better" than HDDs, why are HDDs still produced and used, and not entirely replaced with SSDs?


Answer from Nelson Butterworth


HDDs are still superior in data capacity vs. physical size vs. cost, long-term cold storage of data, and long-term reliability.

Question: What are the differences between radix sort and bucket sort?

Answer from Jagdishsinh Jadeja

The initial pass of both [code ]RadixSort[/code] and[code ]BucketSort[/code] is exactly the same. The elements are put in [code ]buckets[/code] (or [code ]bins[/code]) of incr

Question: Algorithms: What is the difference between Radix sort, Bucket sort and Counting sort?

Answer from Devender Mishra

Similarity: These are not comparison sort. It means keys are not compared with each other.

First, let us time complexity of each algorithms:

Question: Any difference between bucket sort and radix sort for integers?

Answer from Ahmed Fahmy

You can think of radix sort as 10-buckets bucket sort.
It iterates over integers digit by digit , sorting them based on the current "place" being examined.

Question: Why is merge sort better than selection sort?

Answer from Chris Reid

Merge sort outperforms selection sort in two cases: where linked lists are used, and where the data set is very large and will not fit in the CPU’s L2 cache.

Find the median and that is the root node. Then successively divide the remaining numbers into a less-than (L) and a greater-than-or-equal (G) list.

Question: Is merge sort worse than heap sort?

Answer from Nadeem Qureshi

Both sorting algorithms have a worst case complexity of O(nlogn). However, one cannot simply say that one sorting algorithm is better than the other without looking at the sce

Question: What is the most efficient algorithm for the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem?

Answer from Suratna Budalakoti

Jerry is correct: the runtime complexity for LCS is O(m*n). But there are ways to speed up the running time in practice, for example, by creating a reverse index (string to lo

Question: How efficient is bubble sort?

Answer from Jerry Coffin

At an abstract level, the use of bubble sort is (obviously enough) to sort data.

The problem with that, of course, is that under normal circumstances, bubble sort is nearly t
